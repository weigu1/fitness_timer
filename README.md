## Some infos

Three tones are generated. The first darker tone starts the exercise. After e.g. 45&#8239;s a brighter tone indicates that the repeat is finished. After a pause (e.g. 15&#8239;s), the next repeat is done. After x (e.g. 3) repeats a triple tone indicates the end of the exercise.

The display shows this exercise with:

```
    3x45 15 1
```

We have two buttons to choose between 2 programs. Different programs can be assigned to the buttons with the help of an encoder with push-button.
For this we push the rotary encoder, choose the program by rotating, press the button we need (B1 or B2) and push the encoder again.

If we push a button this program starts after 5&#8239;s to allow us to get in position.

We also have a default program that starts when switching on. It is a one time 5 minutes program to calm down and breath, before beginning with the exercises. The programs can be adjusted in code.
